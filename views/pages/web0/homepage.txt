there are a lot of differences and similarities, but basically the main difference is Gets are cached and Posts aren't.

E - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements


8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.

   I worked really hard on this assignment. I found new ways to use CSS and PHP in this assignment and I even was able to make it so that the entire homepage is generated using PHP! I think this is way cool.
